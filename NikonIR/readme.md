Nikon IR remote shutter
=======================

This program mimics an IR remote shutter for Nikon cameras, it needs an IR led on pin 13.
It sends the shoot command every 5 seconds, since I used as an intervalometer in order to capture a sequance of pictures for a timelapse video.

I tested it with my Nikon D40X camera.
