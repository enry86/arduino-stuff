Capacitive sensor
=================

I wrote this sketch some time ago, in order to drive a DIY touch sensor built using a sheet of aluminium foil.

I'll upload some schematics sooner or later, I need to test it in order to check if it's still working correctly :)

I added a small Processing sketch that visualizes the sensor values (pretty much untested as well :) ).
