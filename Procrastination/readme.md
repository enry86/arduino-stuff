Procrastination
===============

This section of the repo is dedicated to my small rover project, which, due to my lack of time, is dubbed "Procrastination".

At the moment I have only a small sketch which controls two servos, making them sweep back and forth. Humble beginnings.

The servos control a small turret on the rover, on which I'll mount an ultrasonic distance sensor.
